# Summary: 
### Our project is supposed to simulate a stock trading website. It will retrieve stock price information from the internet, then allow users to invest fake money, and track how well their stocks do. We will have a login system where people can make accounts and then track their stocks each day using their profiles.

# Timeline:
### This is the link to our active project timeline on padlet: https://padlet.com/bradleybartelt/v44y76kaxvlyg9pd

### We will track these big-ticket items on the Padlet. This Padlet will be updated as we work on the project to help keep track of our goals and what we have completed. The big-ticket items that will be tracked are: Back Log, Assigned, In Progress, Ready for Deploy (In GitHub), Completed (Running on Pi).
